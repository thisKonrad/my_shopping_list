here i build up a little fancy shopping list.
with react in a vite environment.

you have a search function, a sort function
and a status bar that shows you the status of 
your executed shoppinglist in percent.
you can delete single list items and clear the whole list
after you finished your shopping tour.

so lets go shopping :smiley:
