here i build up a little fancy shopping list.

with react and vite.

you have a search function, a sort function
and a status bar 

that shows you the status of 
your executed shoppinglist in percent.

you can delete single list items 
and clear the whole list
after you finished your shopping tour.

so lets go shopping :smiley:
